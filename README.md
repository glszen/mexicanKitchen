# Interactive Menu Toggle

This project is a simple interactive menu system that toggles between different sections of a webpage. It is built using JavaScript to handle the visibility of different elements when corresponding buttons are clicked.

## Features

- **Toggle between sections**: The menu sections (nachos, tacos, burritos, quessa) are shown or hidden based on user interaction.
- **Back button**: A "back" button allows the user to return to the home page section.

## Sections

- **Nachos Section**: Displays nachos-related content.
- **Tacos Section**: Displays tacos-related content.
- **Burritos Section**: Displays burritos-related content.
- **Quessa Section**: Displays quessa-related content.
- **Home Section**: The homepage section that contains the initial view.

## How It Works

The project utilizes the `toggleSection` function to hide or show the content based on which section is selected. Here's the basic flow:
1. The user clicks a button corresponding to a section (e.g., Nachos, Tacos, Burritos, Quessa).
2. The `toggleSection` function hides all sections and then displays the content of the selected section.
3. A "back" button on each section allows the user to return to the homepage.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in VS Code or any text editor of your choice.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the interactive menu in action.
